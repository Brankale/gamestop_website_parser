# GamestopApp
GOAL: You can create a list of your favourite games and look at their prices

The app has been developed using Java, the Jsoup library and Netbeans IDE
If you want to run the project:
- download the ZIP file and import in the editor
- link the Jsoup library to Netbeans (you can find it in the lib folder)

The program now:
- It doesn't have a GUI
- It works just for few categories of products
- It works just for the Italian Website of Gamestop
